# Brunch. v.1

### Problem
having to search through multiple restaurant's menus in order to find what you would like to eat

### Solution
breaking down the search function to what food you are hungry for and giving you those options before getting into the restaurant info.

This is eliminating a step and getting straight to what food you are hungry for.

## Functionality
Brunch. is currently deployed as a fully functional website, working on screen sizes 1000px or larger through Firebase.

You can visit Brunch. at ## [Brunch.](https://brunch-app-project-1.firebaseapp.com)
