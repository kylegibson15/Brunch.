# Brunch. v.1

### Problem Motivation
having to search through multiple restaurant's menus in order to find what you would like to eat

### My Solution
breaking down the search function to what food you are hungry for and giving you those options before getting into the restaurant info.

This is eliminating a step and getting straight to what food you are hungry for.

## Functionality
Brunch. is currently deployed as a fully functional webapp, working on screen sizes 1000px or larger through Firebase.
